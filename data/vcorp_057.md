# Missing Secure Flag in Session Cookies

# Vulnerability Case
During the security assessment of Acme Corp's Go-based web application, our team discovered that the session management functionality was setting cookies without the Mandatory Secure flag. The vulnerability was identified during a code audit of the authentication module, where the session cookie was transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection. This flaw was evident through manual inspection of the cookie configuration and corroborated by network traffic analysis in our staging environment. The missing flag potentially allows an attacker on an unsecured network to intercept session tokens, thereby paving the way for session hijacking incidents.

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
)

func loginHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Simulate user authentication that generates a session token
    cookie := &http.Cookie{
        Name:     "session_token",
        Value:    "random-generated-token",
        Path:     "/",
        HttpOnly: true,
        // Vulnerability: Secure flag is missing, enabling cookie over HTTP.
    }
    http.SetCookie(w, cookie)

    w.Write([]byte("Login Successful"))
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/login", loginHandler)
    // Application deployed using the net/http package on Acme Corp's server.
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

The absence of the Secure flag in the session cookie configuration enables clients to pass the cookie over unencrypted HTTP channels. An attacker capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack could intercept these session tokens, leading to potential session hijacking and unauthorized account access. Given Acme Corp's reliance on Go's standard `net/http` stack in production, this vulnerability compromises user confidentiality, potentially damaging reputation and incurring regulatory and financial repercussions.

context: go.lang.security.audit.net.cookie-missing-secure.cookie-missing-secure A session cookie was detected without setting the 'Secure' flag. The 'secure' flag for cookies prevents the client from transmitting the cookie over insecure channels such as HTTP. Set the 'Secure' flag by setting 'Secure' to 'true' in the Options struct.

# Vulnerability Breakdown
This vulnerability involves a security misconfiguration in Acme Corp's Go-based web application that allows session cookies to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections.

1. **Key vulnerability elements**:
   - Session cookie configuration in the Go web application is missing the 'Secure' flag

# Description
A security vulnerability has been identified in Acme Corp's Go-based web application, specifically in the session cookie configuration of the authentication module. The application sets session cookies without the `Secure` flag, allowing these cookies to be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections.

```go
cookie := &http.Cookie{
    Name:     "session_token",
    Value:    "random-generated-token",
    Path:     "/",
    HttpOnly: true,
    // Vulnerability: Secure flag is missing
}

```

While the application correctly sets the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent JavaScript access to cookies, the missing `Secure` flag means that browsers will transmit these session tokens even over non-HTTPS connections. This exposes authentication credentials to potential interception by attackers who can monitor network traffic, particularly on shared or unsecured networks.

# CVSS
**Score**: 3.1 \
**Vector**: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N \
**Severity**: Low

The vulnerability receives a Low severity rating (CVSS score 3.1) based on the following factors:

- **Attack Vector (AV:A)**: The vulnerability requires the attacker to be on the same network as the victim, which is considered an Adjacent attack vector as it requires specific network positioning.

- **Attack Complexity (AC:H)**: Successfully exploiting this vulnerability requires a high level of complexity. The attacker must not only be on the same network but must also successfully execute a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, which involves network traffic manipulation techniques like ARP spoofing or DNS poisoning. These attacks require specific tools, technical knowledge, and favorable network conditions.

- **Privileges Required (PR:N)**: No special privileges are needed to execute this attack once the attacker has network positioning.

- **User Interaction (UI:N)**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any action from legitimate users beyond their normal interaction with the application.

- **Scope (S:U)**: The vulnerability impacts only the vulnerable component (the web application) and doesn't allow compromise of other components.

- **Confidentiality Impact (C:L)**: The exposure of session tokens can lead to unauthorized access to user information, which represents a Low confidentiality impact.

- **Integrity Impact (I:N)**: The vulnerability itself does not directly impact data integrity as it focuses on the retrieval of session tokens, not the modification of data. While an attacker who later uses a stolen token could potentially modify data, this is a secondary effect and not a direct impact of the vulnerability itself.

- **Availability Impact (A:N)**: This vulnerability doesn't directly impact system availability.

# Exploitation Scenarios
**Scenario 1: Corporate Public WiFi Interception**
An attacker positions themselves on the same public WiFi network used by Acme Corp employees working remotely at a coffee shop. The attacker uses packet sniffing tools like Wireshark to monitor HTTP traffic, but must also establish a successful MITM position using techniques like ARP spoofing. When an employee accesses the company's web application, their session cookie is transmitted over HTTP. The attacker captures this cookie and uses a browser extension like Cookie Editor to inject the stolen session token into their own browser, effectively hijacking the employee's session and gaining unauthorized access to corporate resources.

**Scenario 2: Corporate Network ARP Spoofing**
An attacker who has gained initial access to Acme Corp's internal network (perhaps through phishing) conducts an ARP spoofing attack to redirect traffic between users and the application server through their machine. Using tools like Ettercap or Bettercap, the attacker becomes a "man in the middle" for all traffic. This requires technical expertise and favorable network conditions to avoid detection. When legitimate users access the application, the attacker captures their session cookies transmitted over HTTP and uses them to authenticate as these users, potentially accessing sensitive information.

**Scenario 3: Mixed Content Exploitation**
Acme Corp's main application is served over HTTPS, but includes resources (such as images or JavaScript) loaded over HTTP. Since the session cookies lack the Secure flag, browsers send them with these HTTP requests. An attacker monitoring the network must successfully position themselves to intercept these specific HTTP requests. This mixed content scenario creates a security gap that bypasses some of the protection that HTTPS would normally provide, but still requires the attacker to overcome the complexity of establishing a successful MITM position.

# Impact Analysis
**Business Impact:**
- Potential unauthorized access to user account information
- Risk of confidential data exposure that could trigger regulatory concerns
- Possible violation of regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or industry-specific requirements
- Financial penalties for non-compliance with security standards
- Damage to company reputation if a breach occurs and becomes public
- Loss of customer trust and potential business relationships
- Costs associated with incident response and remediation
- Potential legal liability for failing to implement standard security controls

**Technical Impact:**
- Session token disclosure allowing attackers to potentially impersonate legitimate users
- Unauthorized access to sensitive application information
- Risk of credential exposure if session tokens can be linked to specific users
- Bypassing of authentication mechanisms through stolen session credentials
- Limited to information disclosure rather than direct data modification
- Difficulty attributing unauthorized access in logs as attackers would be using legitimate session tokens
- Security logging systems may not detect this type of attack since the access appears legitimate

# Technical Details
The vulnerability stems from an improper cookie configuration in the Go web application's authentication module. Specifically, the session cookies are created without setting the `Secure` flag:

```go
func loginHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Simulate user authentication that generates a session token
    cookie := &http.Cookie{
        Name:     "session_token",
        Value:    "random-generated-token",
        Path:     "/",
        HttpOnly: true,
        // Vulnerability: Secure flag is missing, enabling cookie over HTTP
    }
    http.SetCookie(w, cookie)

    w.Write([]byte("Login Successful"))
}

```

The `Secure` flag, when set to `true`, instructs browsers to only send the cookie over encrypted HTTPS connections. Without this flag, browsers will transmit the cookie over both secure (HTTPS) and insecure (HTTP) connections.

The issue is compounded by the application server configuration, which listens on port 8080 without TLS encryption:

```go
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/login", loginHandler)
    // Application deployed using the net/http package on Acme Corp's server
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}

```

This creates two critical issues:

1. **Plain HTTP Communication**: The server accepts connections over unencrypted HTTP on port 8080, transmitting all data including cookies in plaintext.

2. **No Transport Layer Security**: Without TLS (HTTPS), all communications between clients and the server can be intercepted and read by attackers who have network visibility.

When a user authenticates, the following occurs:

1. The server generates a session token and sets it as a cookie
2. The cookie is transmitted to the client over HTTP (unencrypted)
3. For subsequent requests, the browser sends this cookie back to the server
4. If any of these requests occur over HTTP, the cookie is transmitted in plaintext

Successfully exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to not only be on the same network but also to successfully execute a MITM attack. This involves complex network manipulation techniques like ARP spoofing, rogue DHCP/DNS servers, or other traffic interception methods. These techniques require specific expertise and favorable network conditions to execute successfully without detection.

The HttpOnly flag does prevent JavaScript from accessing the cookie, but offers no protection against network-level interception. It's important to note that while this vulnerability enables the potential theft of session tokens, it does not directly enable the modification of data, which would be a separate security concern.

# Remediation Steps
## Add Secure Flag to Session Cookies

**Priority**: P0

Immediately update the cookie configuration to include the Secure flag, preventing transmission over non-HTTPS connections:

```go
func loginHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Simulate user authentication that generates a session token
    cookie := &http.Cookie{
        Name:     "session_token",
        Value:    "random-generated-token",
        Path:     "/",
        HttpOnly: true,
        Secure:   true, // Add this line to enable the Secure flag
    }
    http.SetCookie(w, cookie)

    w.Write([]byte("Login Successful"))
}

```

This change ensures that browsers will only send the cookie over HTTPS connections, protecting it from interception even if HTTP endpoints exist. It should be applied to all security-sensitive cookies, not just session tokens.
## Implement HTTPS for All Application Traffic

**Priority**: P1

Configure the application to use HTTPS exclusively by implementing TLS:

```go
import (
    "log"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/login", loginHandler)
    
    // Option 1: Use ListenAndServeTLS instead of ListenAndServe
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServeTLS(":443", "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil))
    
    // Option 2: If you need both HTTP and HTTPS, redirect HTTP to HTTPS
    go func() {
        // Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
        redirectHandler := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
            http.Redirect(w, r, "https://"+r.Host+r.URL.String(), http.StatusMovedPermanently)
        })
        log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":80", redirectHandler))
    }()
    
    // Main HTTPS server
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServeTLS(":443", "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil))
}

```

This ensures all traffic is encrypted, providing comprehensive protection beyond just securing cookies. Additionally, consider implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to instruct browsers to always use HTTPS for your domain.
